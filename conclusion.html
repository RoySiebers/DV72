  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
  <p class ="intro"> So far we have seen that before 1900 the data was very uncertain and the uncertainty factor was too high to draw conclusions form. From 1900 till around the 1970's the temperature would stay relatively the same, but what we have seen is that afterwards the average temperature goes up and doesnt come down again the following years.
  We have also seen that when comparing the data of the 1900's and 2000's from each country we can also see this fenomenon appear.
