  <h1>Line Chart</h1>
  <p>The chart on the left represents the global land temperature of the world at certains years.
  The blue lines represent the uncertainty factor of the measured temperature and the black line represents the temperature measured.</p>
  <p>As we can see in the chart from 1750 till around 1900's the uncertainty factor is of sizable proportions. This makes it very hard to draw any conclusions from this time period. However from the 1900's we can see the temperatures being resonably stable untill the 1970's. After which we can see an upward trend. This goes from around 8 degrees to almost 10 degrees celsius so far.</p>
